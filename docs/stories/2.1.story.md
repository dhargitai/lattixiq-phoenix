## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: Turborepo monorepo structure is established with packages/core for type definitions and apps/web for Next.js app. Type sharing is working correctly between packages.

### Data Models
From architecture documents [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **User interface**: UUID, email, timestamps, user preference fields for authentication and tracking
- **DecisionSprint interface**: For storing problem briefs and commitment memos as JSONB
- **KnowledgeContent interface**: Mental models with 1536-dimensional vector embeddings for semantic search

### API Specifications
From architecture [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]:
- **Streaming Endpoint**: `POST /api/sprint` - Handles entire interactive Phoenix Framework session with streaming UI response managed by Vercel AI SDK
- **Request Body**: Object containing current conversation state and user inputs
- **Response**: Streaming UI response for real-time conversation

### Component Specifications
From architecture [Source: architecture/components.md]:
- **Web UI (Next.js Application)**: User-facing presentation layer managing conversational UI, rendering components, and handling client-side state
- **Phoenix Core Engine**: UI-agnostic TypeScript package with business logic - must be imported for decision sprint logic
- **API Layer**: Netlify Functions serving as bridge between Web UI, Core Engine, and Supabase

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Main Sprint Page**: `apps/web/app/sprint/page.tsx` (Next.js App Router)
- **Sprint Components**: `apps/web/components/sprint/` directory for UI components
- **State Management**: `apps/web/lib/stores/` for Zustand stores
- **Type Imports**: Import from `@phoenix/core` package for shared types
- **UI Components**: Use DaisyUI components from shared packages/ui

### Testing Requirements

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL FINDINGS**: The implementation demonstrates significant effort and comprehensive feature coverage, but contains critical build failures that prevent production deployment. The monorepo structure is implemented correctly, but the core package has extensive TypeScript errors that cascade to the web application.

**Architecture Implementation**: ✅ Good adherence to monorepo structure with proper separation of concerns
**Feature Completeness**: ✅ All AC requirements appear implemented in component structure
**Build System**: ❌ **CRITICAL** - Core package build failing with 100+ TypeScript errors
**Type Safety**: ❌ **CRITICAL** - Cannot import types from @phoenix/core due to build failures

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed due to critical build failures. Must fix core package before code improvements can be safely made.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ❌ Type sharing violated - duplicated types in web app and core package, strict typing compromised with 'any' usage
- **Project Structure**: ✅ Monorepo structure correctly implemented with proper workspace organization
- **Testing Strategy**: ❌ Test suite cannot execute due to build failures and configuration issues
- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ Cannot verify due to inability to run application

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Issues (MUST FIX BEFORE MERGE):**
- [ ] Fix all TypeScript build errors in packages/core (100+ errors)
- [ ] Resolve type import failures from @phoenix/core to web app
- [ ] Fix test suite configuration and dependencies
- [ ] Remove all 'any' types in API routes and components
- [ ] Fix React JSX unescaped entities (23 linting violations)

**Architecture Issues:**
- [ ] Move KnowledgeContent and related types from web app to @phoenix/core
- [ ] Ensure all shared types are properly exported from core package
- [ ] Implement proper error types instead of generic Error handling

**Testing Issues:**
- [ ] Fix Jest/Vitest configuration conflicts in test files
- [ ] Add proper test setup file with DOM matchers
- [ ] Resolve AI SDK mock imports in component tests
- [ ] Add integration test configuration

### Security Review

**CONCERNS IDENTIFIED**:
- API endpoints use proper error handling patterns but compromise type safety with 'any' types
- No obvious security vulnerabilities in authentication or authorization patterns
- Semantic search API has appropriate input validation and error handling

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:
- Replace all 'any' types with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Add rate limiting considerations to API documentation
- Verify environment variable validation in production deployment

### Performance Considerations

Cannot assess performance due to build failures. Key areas to validate after fixes:
- Semantic search API performance with vector operations
- State persistence performance with Zustand
- Bundle size impact of AI SDK and dependencies

### Files Modified During Review

None - refactoring blocked by critical build failures.

**CRITICAL**: Request developer to update File List after fixing build errors, as core package issues prevent safe modifications.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/2.1-sprint-view-implementation.yml
Risk profile: **HIGH RISK** - 4 high severity, 2 medium severity issues identified
Quality Score: **40/100** (Below minimum acceptable threshold)

### Recommended Status

**❌ Changes Required - Critical build failures must be resolved**

**BLOCKING CONDITIONS:**
1. Core package must build successfully without TypeScript errors
2. Web app must successfully import types from @phoenix/core 
3. Test suite must be executable with proper configuration
4. All linting violations must be resolved

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Focus on packages/core TypeScript errors first (root cause)
2. Verify type exports and imports work correctly
3. Fix test configuration and dependencies
4. Address remaining linting and architecture issues
5. Re-submit for QA review after critical fixes

### Review Date: 2025-09-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS**: The critical TypeScript build errors in packages/core have been fully resolved. The core engine now compiles successfully and serves as a solid foundation for the monorepo architecture. However, several architectural compliance issues and linting warnings remain that need attention before production readiness.

**Core Package**: ✅ Successfully builds with all TypeScript errors resolved
**Architecture Compliance**: ⚠️ Some violations of coding standards regarding type sharing
**Feature Implementation**: ✅ All acceptance criteria appear to be implemented in component structure
**Test Coverage**: ⚠️ Adequate test files present but cannot execute due to web app linting failures

### Refactoring Performed

**Critical Fixes Applied:**
- **File**: packages/core/src/orchestration/phase-manager.test.ts
  - **Change**: Added missing `phaseData: {}` field to 3 PhaseContext test objects
  - **Why**: Required by updated PhaseContext interface specification
  - **How**: Ensures test compatibility with latest type definitions

- **File**: packages/core/src/orchestration/phoenix-orchestrator.test.ts
  - **Change**: Added missing `title` field to FrameworkSelection test objects
  - **Why**: FrameworkSelection interface requires title field for proper identification
  - **How**: Provides meaningful framework titles in test scenarios

- **File**: packages/core/src/phases/problem-intake-handler.test.ts
  - **Change**: Added missing `phaseData: {}` field to 6 PhaseContext test objects
  - **Why**: Maintains consistency with updated interface requirements
  - **How**: Ensures all test contexts conform to current type specifications

- **File**: packages/core/src/services/ai-router.test.ts
  - **Change**: Added missing `phaseData: {}` and `title` fields to test objects
  - **Why**: Interface compliance and test data completeness
  - **How**: Provides complete test fixtures for integration testing

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Core package properly decoupled, but web app duplicates types instead of importing from core
- **Project Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Monorepo structure correctly implemented with proper workspace organization
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** - Test files present but cannot execute due to web app linting failures
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ **PASS** - All 8 acceptance criteria have corresponding implementation components
