# **Introduction**

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **The Phoenix Framework**. It serves as the single source of truth for development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This design adheres to all technical assumptions and the sequential epic plan outlined in the PRD, with a primary focus on a **decoupled core engine** that is cleanly separated from the Next.js presentation layer.

## **Starter Template**

For a greenfield project with this stack, using a starter template can significantly accelerate setup. It is recommended to use an official or community-vetted **Turborepo starter template** that includes Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The architecture defined herein will then be implemented within that structure.
