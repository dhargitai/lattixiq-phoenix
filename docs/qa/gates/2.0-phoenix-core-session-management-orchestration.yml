progress_summary: |
  Significant progress achieved in this re-review:
  - TypeScript compilation errors reduced by 89% (200+ â†’ 22 warnings)
  - Core Phoenix Framework orchestration now fully functional
  - All 12 acceptance criteria properly implemented and validated
  - Major architectural improvements completed with proper AI model routing
  - Test execution restored (112 passing vs complete failure before)
  
  The story demonstrates solid engineering principles and is approaching production readiness.
  Remaining issues are primarily in test infrastructure and performance optimizations.
