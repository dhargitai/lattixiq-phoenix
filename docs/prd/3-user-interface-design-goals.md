# **3. User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience should feel less like using a "tool" and more like engaging in a focused, guided conversation with a calm, expert strategist. The entire flow should be designed to take the user from a state of chaotic overwhelm to one of confident clarity. The aesthetic should be minimalist, clean, and professional, prioritizing focus and readability above all else.

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**

- **One-Thing-at-a-Time:** The interface will present only one question, task, or piece of information at a time to prevent overwhelming the user.
- **Conversational Flow:** Interactions will be driven by a conversational, chat-like interface, using the Vercel AI SDK to stream responses and make the experience feel dynamic and alive.
- **The Living Document:** The outputs (like the "Commitment Memo") should feel like they are being co-created in real-time, not just generated at the end.

## **Core Screens and Views**

Conceptually, the application will have two main areas for the MVP:

1. **The Sprint View:** The primary, full-screen interface where a user is guided through a single "Phoenix Framework" decision sprint from start to finish.
2. **The Dashboard / Hangar:** A central hub where users can see a list of their past decision sprints and review their "Commitment Memos."

## **Accessibility**

- **Standard:** The application will adhere to **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities.

## **Branding**

- **Feel:** The branding should evoke feelings of clarity, confidence, and calm intelligence. The aesthetic is a mix between the clean utility of a tool like **Notion** and the focused, anxiety-reducing feel of an app like **Calm**.
- **Visuals:** Minimalist typography, a muted and professional color palette, and generous use of white space.

## **Target Device and Platforms**

- **Primary:** The initial build will be a **Web Responsive** application, designed mobile-first to ensure a seamless experience on any device.
