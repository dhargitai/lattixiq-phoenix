# **1. Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**

- To create a "painkiller" solution that **breaks the cycle of analysis paralysis** for early-stage startup founders facing a specific, high-stakes decision.
- To provide an interactive, guided experience that measurably increases a founder's **confidence** in their decision-making process.
- To ensure the system's UX is explicitly designed to **reduce user anxiety and cognitive load.**
- To build the product on a **well-separated, testable, and platform-agnostic core architecture** to ensure quality and future flexibility.
- To **validate the core framework quickly** with a targeted group of founders before expanding the feature set.

## **Background Context**

The project began as LattixIQ, a platform for learning mental models. Market research revealed that "learning" is a "vitamin" (nice-to-have), while the target audience of **startup founders** suffers from an acute, urgent "pain" of decision paralysis. This led to the design of "The Phoenix Framework," an interactive decision sprint. The system leverages a dynamic, semantically searchable knowledge base of mental models to guide a founder from a state of chaotic uncertainty to one of confident, committed action.
