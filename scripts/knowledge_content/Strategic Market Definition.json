  "hook": "Ever wonder why Google claims it's just a 'search company' competing with everyone, while your local pizza shop insists it's the 'only authentic Neapolitan place in town'?",
  "definition": "Strategic Market Definition reveals how companies deliberately frame their competitive landscape: monopolists define their market broadly to appear competitive and avoid regulation, while competitors define theirs narrowly to seem unique and dominant in their niche.",
  "analogy_or_metaphor": "It's like a basketball player claiming to be just 'an athlete among millions' when facing scrutiny, but 'the best point guard in the league' when seeking recognition—same person, different framing.",
  "key_takeaway": "**How you define your market determines whether you appear dominant or desperate.**",
  "classic_example": "Railroad companies in the early 1900s defined themselves narrowly as 'railroads' instead of broadly as 'transportation,' missing the rise of cars and planes, ultimately losing their dominance through myopic market definition.",
  "modern_example": "Amazon describes itself as competing in 'retail' (a massive market where it seems small) when facing antitrust concerns, but positions itself as dominating 'e-commerce infrastructure' when pitching to investors.",
  "pitfall": "Founders often define their market too narrowly, creating a false sense of uniqueness that blinds them to real competition and larger opportunities.",
  "payoff": "Understanding this bias helps you see through corporate narratives, make better investment decisions, and accurately assess your own competitive position.",
  "visual_metaphor": "A telescope that can zoom in to make a small pond look vast, or zoom out to make an ocean look like a puddle—same view, different lens settings.",
  "dive_deeper_mechanism": "This bias exploits our tendency to accept frame-dependent information without questioning the framing itself. Companies leverage loss aversion (fear of regulation for monopolists) and status-seeking (desire to appear unique for competitors) to manipulate stakeholder perceptions. The human mind struggles to hold multiple market definitions simultaneously, making us susceptible to whichever frame is presented most convincingly.",
  "dive_deeper_origin_story": "Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, crystallized this concept in 'Zero to One' after observing how his own companies navigated regulatory scrutiny. He noticed PayPal downplayed its payments dominance by emphasizing competition with banks, credit cards, and cash, while startups he mentored inflated their uniqueness by defining impossibly narrow markets. This pattern revealed a systematic distortion in how market position gets communicated.",
  "dive_deeper_pitfalls_nuances": "**Common Mistake:** Thinking this only applies to big corporations—small businesses and individuals use this constantly. **Reality Check:** Your competitor's 'tiny niche' might actually be a huge market they're intentionally obscuring, and your 'massive opportunity' might be a narrow slice you've convinced yourself is bigger than it is. The key is learning to zoom in and out deliberately, not getting trapped in either extreme.",
