  "hook": "Ever notice how word spreads faster about layoffs than promotions? What you do when people leave shapes what everyone who stays thinks about staying.",
  "definition": "The principle that how you handle employee departures—especially involuntary ones like layoffs—directly impacts the trust, morale, and retention of your remaining workforce.",
  "analogy_or_metaphor": "It's like hosting a dinner party where everyone watches how you treat the guest who has to leave early—their experience becomes everyone else's expectation.",
  "key_takeaway": "**Your departing employees are your company's character witnesses to those who remain.**",
  "classic_example": "Companies that provide generous severance packages, career transition support, and respectful communication during layoffs often maintain higher employee loyalty and easier future hiring.",
  "modern_example": "When tech companies announce layoffs via impersonal emails or suddenly revoke access without explanation, the remaining employees immediately start updating their LinkedIn profiles and questioning their job security.",
  "pitfall": "Treating departures poorly creates a culture of fear and distrust, leading to talent flight and difficulty attracting quality candidates in the future.",
  "payoff": "Handling exits with dignity builds a reputation for integrity, increases employee loyalty, and creates ambassadors who speak positively about your company even after leaving.",
  "visual_metaphor": "A bridge with people crossing both directions—those leaving safely reach the other side while those staying feel confident the bridge will hold when their time comes.",
  "dive_deeper_mechanism": "This principle works because employees are constantly evaluating their psychological safety and future prospects within an organization. How departures are handled serves as the most concrete evidence of leadership values and company culture. When people see colleagues treated with respect during difficult transitions, it reinforces trust in leadership and reduces anxiety about their own job security. Conversely, poor handling of exits triggers survival instincts and defensive behaviors that damage productivity and engagement.",
  "dive_deeper_origin_story": "This principle gained prominence through the experiences of veteran CEOs like Ben Horowitz during the dot-com crash, where companies faced massive layoffs. Leaders who maintained dignity and fairness during these difficult periods found their remaining teams more loyal and productive. The concept was further validated by research showing that 'survivor syndrome'—the psychological impact on employees who remain after layoffs—significantly affects performance and retention rates.",
  "dive_deeper_pitfalls_nuances": "**Myth:** Being 'nice' during exits means avoiding tough decisions or keeping underperformers longer. **Reality:** Fairness means making necessary decisions decisively while treating people with dignity throughout the process. The goal isn't to avoid difficult conversations but to handle them professionally. Another common mistake is assuming this only applies to layoffs—how you handle resignations, retirements, and even terminations for cause all send powerful signals to your organization.",
