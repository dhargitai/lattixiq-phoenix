  "hook": "Ever wondered why 72% of new products fail? It might be because their creators thought asking customers what they wanted would kill their creativity.",
  "definition": "The mistaken belief that innovation requires complete isolation from external input, especially customer feedback and financial considerations, to protect the purity of creative ideas.",
  "analogy_or_metaphor": "Like a chef who refuses to taste their food or ask diners for feedback, believing that culinary art should never be \"contaminated\" by knowing what people actually want to eat.",
  "key_takeaway": "**True innovation thrives on feedback, not isolation.**",
  "classic_example": "The popular image of Newton discovering gravity alone under an apple tree, when in reality he built extensively on the work of Galileo, Kepler, and countless correspondences with peers like Leibniz.",
  "modern_example": "Startups that spend years perfecting their product in stealth mode, refusing customer input because they believe it will compromise their vision, only to launch something nobody wants or needs.",
  "pitfall": "Building products based on internal assumptions leads to expensive failures and solutions that don't solve real problems.",
  "payoff": "Embracing early feedback and collaboration creates products people actually want and accelerates successful innovation.",
  "visual_metaphor": "A lightbulb surrounded by a thick wall with \"Keep Out\" signs, while outside, potential users hold keys that could unlock the door to successful innovation.",
  "dive_deeper_mechanism": "This myth persists because it aligns with cultural narratives of individualism and heroism. Our brains are wired to prefer simple, dramatic stories of lone heroes over complex tales of collaboration. The myth also protects our ego—it's easier to blame \"outside interference\" for failure than to admit our original ideas might be flawed. Additionally, many innovators fear that external input will dilute their creative vision, not realizing that constraints and feedback often enhance rather than limit creativity.",
  "dive_deeper_origin_story": "The myth gained traction during the Romantic era's emphasis on individual genius, reinforced by oversimplified stories of famous inventors. The 1997 Apple \"Think Different\" campaign, featuring rebellious artists like Miles Davis, epitomized this mindset in business. Even a 2012 Dodge Dart commercial proclaimed \"Kick out the finance guys!\" reflecting the widespread belief that business considerations corrupt pure innovation. However, modern research reveals that even celebrated \"lone geniuses\" like Einstein used colleagues as sounding boards and built on collaborative networks.",
  "dive_deeper_pitfalls_nuances": "**Common Misconception:** Customer feedback will compromise your creative vision. **Reality:** Early input helps refine and focus creativity toward real needs. **Another Myth:** Financial considerations kill innovation. **Truth:** Understanding willingness to pay early prevents building expensive solutions to non-existent problems. The key nuance is timing—not avoiding feedback, but knowing when and how to incorporate it effectively.",
