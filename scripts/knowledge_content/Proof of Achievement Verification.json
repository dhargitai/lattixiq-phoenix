  "hook": "Ever wonder why that new sales hire who talked a big game in interviews completely flopped? Maybe you should have asked for their W2.",
  "definition": "A verification method that requires candidates to provide tangible, concrete evidence of their self-reported achievements rather than relying solely on verbal claims.",
  "analogy_or_metaphor": "It's like being a detective who doesn't just listen to witness testimony—you demand to see the fingerprints, DNA evidence, and security footage before making your case.",
  "key_takeaway": "**Trust, but verify—especially when the stakes are high.**",
  "classic_example": "A sales manager requiring candidates to show actual CRM screenshots of their pipeline performance, quota achievements, and deal progression rather than just accepting verbal claims about their success.",
  "modern_example": "A hiring manager asking a social media specialist to provide analytics screenshots showing actual engagement rates, follower growth, and conversion metrics from their previous campaigns—not just impressive-sounding numbers on their resume.",
  "pitfall": "Accepting inflated or fabricated claims leads to costly hiring mistakes, wasted training resources, and team disruption when the truth inevitably emerges.",
  "payoff": "Implementing proof verification dramatically improves hiring accuracy, reduces turnover, and ensures you build teams with genuinely capable performers.",
  "visual_metaphor": "A magnifying glass examining a document with verification checkmarks, representing the careful scrutiny of claims against tangible evidence.",
  "dive_deeper_mechanism": "This verification principle works because it exploits a fundamental psychological reality: people are far more likely to exaggerate or fabricate claims when they believe those claims can't be easily verified. By requiring concrete proof, you eliminate the incentive to embellish and create a natural filter that separates genuine high performers from those who merely talk a good game. The method leverages the principle that authentic achievement leaves digital footprints—CRM data, tax documents, performance metrics—that are much harder to fake than verbal claims.",
  "dive_deeper_origin_story": "This approach gained prominence in the tech sales world where hiring mistakes are particularly costly—a bad enterprise sales hire can cost hundreds of thousands in lost deals and wasted salary. Sales leaders like Pete Kazanjy began systematizing this approach after witnessing too many 'rock star' candidates who interviewed brilliantly but had never actually closed significant deals. The method emerged from the recognition that sales, unlike many other roles, generates abundant verifiable data through CRM systems, commission statements, and quota reports.",
  "dive_deeper_pitfalls_nuances": "**Common misconception:** That asking for proof is invasive or shows distrust. **Reality:** Top performers are usually proud to share their achievements and appreciate working for organizations that value actual results over smooth talking. **Another pitfall:** Focusing only on raw numbers without understanding context—a candidate might have lower absolute numbers but have worked in a more challenging market or with a inferior product. The key is using proof as a starting point for deeper conversation, not as a simple pass/fail metric.",
