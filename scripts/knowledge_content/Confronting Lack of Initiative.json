  "hook": "Ever notice how some team members wait to be told what to do, even when problems are staring them in the face?",
  "definition": "A management technique for addressing passive team members by directly confronting their pattern of inaction and explicitly raising expectations for proactive problem-solving and ownership.",
  "analogy_or_metaphor": "Like a coach who stops accepting \"I didn't know what to do\" from players who've been on the team long enough to recognize when the play isn't working.",
  "key_takeaway": "**Address the pattern of passivity, not just the individual incident.**",
  "classic_example": "A manager notices an employee consistently brings problems to them without attempting solutions, waiting for direction on tasks they're qualified to handle independently.",
  "modern_example": "A team member repeatedly asks \"What should I do?\" when a system goes down, despite having the training and authority to follow standard troubleshooting procedures, forcing their manager to micromanage routine issues.",
  "pitfall": "Passive team members create bottlenecks, increase your workload, and prevent organizational growth while others lose respect for both the passive employee and management's tolerance of it.",
  "payoff": "Clear expectations for initiative create self-sufficient team members, reduce management burden, and build a culture where problems get solved quickly without escalation.",
  "visual_metaphor": "A traffic light stuck on yellow—everyone waits for someone else to make the first move, while progress stalls.",
  "dive_deeper_mechanism": "This technique works by making the implicit expectation of initiative explicit. Many passive employees aren't lazy—they've learned that waiting is safer than acting and potentially making mistakes. By directly addressing the pattern and clearly communicating that initiative is expected and valued, you shift the risk-reward calculation. The key is focusing on the behavioral pattern rather than individual incidents, which helps the person recognize their default mode of operation.",
  "dive_deeper_origin_story": "This concept emerged from the accountability frameworks developed by Kerry Patterson and his colleagues in 'Crucial Conversations.' They observed that managers often get trapped in cycles where they repeatedly solve problems for team members who should be solving them independently. The breakthrough insight was that these situations require a conversation about the relationship and expectations, not just the immediate problem at hand.",
  "dive_deeper_pitfalls_nuances": "**Common mistake:** Assuming people know they should take initiative when you've never explicitly communicated that expectation. **Reality check:** Some cultures and previous work environments actively discourage initiative, so people may need explicit permission and encouragement to act independently. **Nuance:** This isn't about eliminating all questions or guidance—it's about shifting from \"What should I do?\" to \"Here's what I think we should do, what do you think?\"",
  "extra_content": "## The CPR Framework for Addressing Initiative Issues\n\n### Content Level (First Instance)\nAddress the immediate situation:\n- \"You brought me this problem without attempting any solutions first\"\n- \"What are some approaches you could have tried before escalating this?\"\n- Focus on the specific incident and what should have happened\n\n### Pattern Level (Repeated Instances)\nAddress the recurring behavior:\n- \"This is the third time this month you've asked me to solve something you're qualified to handle\"\n- \"I'm seeing a pattern where you wait for direction instead of taking initiative\"\n- \"I need you to attempt solutions before bringing problems to me\"\n\n### Relationship Level (Ongoing Issues)\nAddress how the pattern affects working relationship:\n- \"This pattern is putting me in a micromanaging role that neither of us wants\"\n- \"I'm starting to question whether you feel empowered to make decisions in your role\"\n- \"Let's talk about what support you need to feel confident taking initiative\"\n\n### Setting Clear Initiative Expectations\n\n1. **Define the Decision Rights**\n   - Clarify what decisions they can make independently\n   - Establish spending limits, approval thresholds, or other boundaries\n   - Document these expectations for reference\n\n2. **Implement the \"Solutions, Not Problems\" Rule**\n   - When bringing issues forward, require 2-3 potential solutions\n   - Ask \"What have you already tried?\" and \"What would you do if I weren't available?\"\n   - Praise good attempts even if the solution isn't perfect\n\n3. **Create Safety for Initiative**\n   - Explicitly state that reasonable mistakes while taking initiative are acceptable\n   - Share examples of good initiative-taking from other team members\n   - Provide regular feedback on decision-making quality\n\n### Progressive Response Framework\n\n**Level 1:** Redirect in the moment\n- \"Before we discuss this, what solutions have you considered?\"\n- \"What would you recommend we do?\"\n\n**Level 2:** Schedule a pattern conversation\n- \"I want to talk about how we handle problems and decision-making\"\n- Use the CPR framework to address the pattern directly\n\n**Level 3:** Formal performance discussion\n- Document the expectation for initiative in performance goals\n- Create specific metrics or examples of proactive behavior\n- Set clear timeline for improvement",
