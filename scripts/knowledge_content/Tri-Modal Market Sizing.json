  "hook": "Ever wonder if your brilliant startup idea has enough customers to actually pay your bills? The answer lies in three very different research paths.",
  "definition": "A strategic framework that recognizes B2B, B2BC, and B2C markets require fundamentally different research methodologies to accurately determine market size and opportunity.",
  "analogy_or_metaphor": "Like using different maps for different terrains - you wouldn't use a subway map to navigate mountains, and you can't use B2C research methods to map B2B markets.",
  "key_takeaway": "**Different customer types demand different market research approaches - one size fits none.**",
  "classic_example": "Enterprise software companies can rely on public financial records and industry reports from firms like Gartner, while consumer app developers must piece together data from multiple sources like app store analytics and social media metrics.",
  "modern_example": "A B2B SaaS founder can find precise market data through LinkedIn Sales Navigator and company databases, while a TikTok influencer launching a product has to estimate their market through engagement rates and follower demographics.",
  "pitfall": "Using the wrong research method leads to wildly inaccurate market estimates, causing either missed opportunities or wasted resources chasing phantom markets.",
  "payoff": "Matching your research approach to your market type gives you reliable data to make confident business decisions and avoid costly strategic mistakes.",
  "visual_metaphor": "Three different magnifying glasses examining three different landscapes - a corporate building (B2B), a shopping mall (B2C), and a hybrid office-retail space (B2BC).",
  "dive_deeper_mechanism": "The framework works because different customer segments have different information visibility patterns. B2B customers leave extensive digital footprints through public filings, professional networks, and industry databases. B2C customers generate behavioral data through consumer platforms and social media. B2BC customers require hybrid approaches since they span both worlds. Each segment's purchasing behavior, decision-making process, and information transparency demands tailored research methodologies.",
  "dive_deeper_origin_story": "Developed by entrepreneur Arvid Kahl through his experience building startups across all three market types. After struggling with inaccurate market sizing that led to poor business decisions, he systematically identified why traditional 'one-size-fits-all' market research failed. His insight came from realizing that B2B customers are legally required to share financial information, while B2C data is fragmented across platforms, and B2BC markets need elements of both approaches.",
  "dive_deeper_pitfalls_nuances": "**Common mistake:** Assuming market size numbers are static - industries expand and contract rapidly, making any figure outdated within weeks. **Reality check:** All market size estimates are tentative at best, and exact numbers don't exist anyway since companies wouldn't publicize juicy opportunities that invite competition. **Research trap:** Spending days looking for a perfect number instead of weeks gathering directional insights from multiple sources, including obscure industry podcasts where experts casually drop valuable data points.",
