  "hook": "Ever wonder why some sales meetings feel smooth and natural while others feel awkward and pushy? It's all about the structure.",
  "definition": "A systematic five-part framework for conducting effective sales meetings that guides prospects naturally from initial connection to purchase decision.",
  "analogy_or_metaphor": "Like a well-choreographed dance, each stage flows seamlessly into the next—you wouldn't jump straight to the finale without building rhythm and connection first.",
  "key_takeaway": "**Structure turns sales conversations from awkward pitches into natural problem-solving sessions.**",
  "classic_example": "The door-to-door encyclopedia salesman who first complimented your home (rapport), asked about your children's education (discovery), showed sample pages (presentation), let you flip through volumes (demo), then offered payment plans (pricing & closing).",
  "modern_example": "A SaaS sales rep who starts by discussing your industry challenges, uncovers specific pain points through questions, presents tailored solutions, provides a live software walkthrough, then discusses pricing tiers that match your needs.",
  "pitfall": "Jumping straight to features and pricing without building trust or understanding needs leads to rejection and wasted time for both parties.",
  "payoff": "Following this structure increases close rates, builds stronger customer relationships, and creates more qualified prospects who actually succeed with your solution.",
  "visual_metaphor": "A staircase with five distinct steps, each one building upward toward a summit marked with a handshake—you can't skip steps without losing your footing.",
  "dive_deeper_mechanism": "This structure works because it mirrors the psychological buying journey. Rapport-building activates the brain's social acceptance mechanisms, discovery uncovers emotional motivators, presentation creates logical justification, demonstration provides tangible proof, and structured closing reduces decision anxiety by making the next step clear and low-risk.",
  "dive_deeper_origin_story": "This framework evolved from door-to-door sales pioneers in the early 1900s who discovered that unstructured pitches failed 90% of the time. Companies like Fuller Brush and Avon systematized these stages, finding that salespeople following the structure outsold unstructured approaches by 300%. Modern B2B sales adapted these principles for complex software and service sales.",
  "dive_deeper_pitfalls_nuances": "**Common mistake:** Treating this as a rigid script rather than a flexible framework—the stages should flow naturally based on prospect responses. **Another pitfall:** Spending too much time on rapport with busy executives who prefer efficiency, or rushing discovery with relationship-oriented buyers who need more trust-building first.",
