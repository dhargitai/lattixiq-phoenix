  "hook": "Ever wonder how anthropologists map entire cultures starting from just one village? They follow the social threads.",
  "definition": "An iterative research strategy for mapping an audience's ecosystem by starting in one community and using its connections to discover adjacent groups, ensuring comprehensive understanding of the market.",
  "analogy_or_metaphor": "Like following a river system - you start at one tributary and trace every branch and connection until you've mapped the entire watershed of your audience.",
  "key_takeaway": "**Start small, follow connections, map the whole ecosystem.**",
  "classic_example": "Anthropologists studying indigenous cultures begin with one village, then follow trade routes, marriage connections, and cultural exchanges to understand the entire regional network of communities.",
  "modern_example": "A fitness app targeting runners starts by deeply understanding marathon training groups, then discovers connections to triathlon clubs, hiking communities, and yoga practitioners - revealing a much larger wellness ecosystem than originally imagined.",
  "pitfall": "Stopping at the first community you find leads to tunnel vision and missed market opportunities.",
  "payoff": "Following community connections reveals hidden customer segments and unexpected market expansion possibilities.",
  "visual_metaphor": "A network diagram starting with one central node that branches out in multiple directions, with each connection revealing new clusters of interconnected communities.",
  "dive_deeper_mechanism": "This strategy works because communities rarely exist in isolation - they form interconnected ecosystems through shared interests, overlapping demographics, and natural progressions. Each community acts as a gateway to adjacent ones, creating a comprehensive map through systematic exploration rather than guesswork.",
  "dive_deeper_origin_story": "This approach emerged from ethnographic research methods where anthropologists realized that understanding one community in isolation provided an incomplete picture. By following social, economic, and cultural connections between groups, researchers could map entire cultural ecosystems and understand how communities influence each other.",
  "dive_deeper_pitfalls_nuances": "**Common mistake:** Assuming all connected communities are equally valuable markets - some connections may be weak or one-directional. **Reality check:** Not every community connection represents a business opportunity; focus on communities with genuine overlap in needs, values, or behaviors rather than superficial demographic similarities.",
